This repository contains the source code for the [Rapid Development with Vite](https://vueschool.io/courses/rapid-development-with-vite) course.

Vite is a first-in-class build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. 

In this course, we cover everything you need to know in order to get a Vue.js project up and running with Vite. From understanding how Vite works under the hood, to starting your new Vue projects with Vite, to the wealth of Vite features, to migrating from Vue CLI to Vite, we cover it all!

Topics include:

* starting a project using `npm init vite`, the create-vue tool, or a community provided vite template.
* writing styles in vue components, in seperate stylesheets, with your favorite pre-processor, or even with CSS modules
* working with images and static assets in Vite
* using Vite to bundle your application for production
* migrating an existing Vue CLI project to Vite
* creating Vite templates
* and using and creating Vite plugins
